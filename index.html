<h1>Food Fight</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
Food Fight is a senior project developed by three students at Cal Poly. The team spent 20 weeks 
learning about game design and developing the game from scratch. My main contributions were building 
the collision detection and game state systems, and enemy artificial intelligence. You can read more 
about the project by grabbing a <a href="anhung_snrproj.pdf">PDF copy</a> of my report.
